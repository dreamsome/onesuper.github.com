A one-week project. Briefed as follows:


In Computer Science, graph traversal is a set of problems of visiting all the nodes in a graph in a particular manner, updating and/or checking their attributes along the way.


Traditional algorithm books(e.g. CLRS) visualize the process of traversing by presenting a series of snapshots:

And a table to reflect the changes to the intermediate variables, like:

OK... They are just books. How could we ask for more?


I tailored <a href="http://getspringy.com/">springy.js</a>, a library using directed forced algorithm to layout graph, to visualize several graph traversal algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra SSSP, Prim MST, etc. 


The visualiztions are intended to help one understand the process of exploration and how the values are updated during traversal.
