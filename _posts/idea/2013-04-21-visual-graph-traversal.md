A one-week project. Briefed as follows:


In Computer Science, graph traversal is a set of problems of visiting all the nodes(or vertices in a graph in a particular manner, updating and/or checking their attributes along the way.


Graph is a very common representation in many applications. Graph traversal algorithms provide crucial tools in many computational fields ranging from genomics to electronic design automation(EDA) to social network analysis.


Generally, graph has more complicated structure than array, list, and tree. The representation of graph could either be adjacency matrix or adjacency list and different data structures are preferred in different situation. For example, adjacency lists are often used to represent sparse graph due to less edge storage. 


Traditional algorithm books(like CLRS) "visualize" the process of traversing by presenting a series of snapshots:

And a table to reflect the changes to the intermediate variables, like:

OK... They are just books. How could we ask for more?
